AD VIDEOS FOLDER
================

Place .mp4 video files in this folder to use as continue ads in Endless mode.

When a player loses in Endless mode, they can watch a random ad from this folder
to continue playing. After watching, a bomb will explode in the second-to-bottom
row, clearing space to continue.

Supported formats: .mp4
Recommended length: 15-30 seconds

Note: Videos are selected randomly. If no videos are present, a 3-second
placeholder screen will be shown instead.
